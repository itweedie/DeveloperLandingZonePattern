### Description

This document outlines the approach for organizing, categorizing, and processing non-functional requirements (NFRs) within the Power Platform ecosystem. It provides a structured methodology for distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements, and establishes a hierarchy for organizing NFRs across different architectural levels.

### Out of Scope

- Specific implementation details for individual NFRs
- Functional requirement analysis
- Tool-specific configuration details

### Key Touch points with other features

- **Architecture Guidelines:** Establishes standards that apply across all features
- **Development Standards:** Defines coding and development practices
- **Security Framework:** Integrates security requirements across all levels
- **User Experience Standards:** Defines front-end and accessibility requirements

## Non-Functional Requirements Framework

### Definition and Scope

**Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)** define how a system performs its functions rather than what it does. They specify quality attributes, constraints, and system-wide behaviors that cut across functional boundaries.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Define system quality attributes (performance, security, usability)
- Apply to system behavior rather than specific features
- Often measurable and testable
- Impact multiple functional areas
- Influence architectural decisions

## Requirements Classification Process

### Step 1: Functional vs Non-Functional Separation

The first step involves distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements using the following criteria:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Requirement] --> B{Does it describe WHAT the system should do?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Functional Requirement]
    B -->|No| D{Does it describe HOW the system should behave?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Non-Functional Requirement]
    D -->|No| F[Review and Clarify]
    
    C --> G[Remove from NFR Process]
    E --> H[Proceed to NFR Classification]
    F --> I[Engage with Business]
```

### Step 2: Non-Functional Requirements Categorization

Once identified as NFRs, requirements are categorized into the following hierarchy:

```mermaid

**Examples:**
- "System must support 1000 concurrent users"
- "All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit"
- "System uptime must be 99.9%"

### 2. Architecture Guidelines

**Scope:** Cross-cutting concerns that influence architectural decisions across all applications and features.

**Categories:**

### 4. Application Level NFRs

**Scope:** Requirements specific to user-facing applications and interfaces.

**Categories:**
- **User Interface:** Design consistency, responsiveness, navigation
- **Accessibility:** WCAG compliance, screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- **Usability:** User experience, workflow efficiency, help systems
- **Browser Compatibility:** Supported browsers, mobile responsiveness

**Examples:**
- "Application must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards"
- "Pages must load within 3 seconds on standard hardware"

### 5. Feature Specific NFRs

**Scope:** Requirements that apply to specific business features or functional areas.

**Categories:**
- **Business Logic Constraints:** Validation rules, workflow requirements
- **Data Validation Rules:** Input validation, data format requirements
- **Integration Points:** Third-party system interactions, data exchange formats
- **Workflow Requirements:** Process timing, approval chains, notifications

**Examples:**
- "Case processing workflow must complete within 24 hours"
- "Document uploads must be virus-scanned before storage"
- "Financial calculations must be accurate to 2 decimal places"
